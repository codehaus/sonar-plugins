Issue: Jlint seems to behave diferently on Windows and on linux. 
Description:
Windows: Jlint 3.1 compiled on Windows with Cygwin (gcc 3.4.x)
Linux: Jlint 3.0. provided with Ubuntu 9.04 and
       Jlint 3.1 compile from source on Ubuntu 9.04

On windows, the output produced by Jlint does not include the full
pathname.  E.g. this is the output of Jlint on windows when the following command
is run

c:\> jlint <project dir>\target\classes
org/jgroups/demos/TotalTokenDemo.java:175: Comparison always produces the same result.
org/jgroups/demos/TotalTokenDemo.java:192: Comparison always produces the same result.

Jlint does not output the full path of the java source file. It only outputs the 
package structure - which is what is needed.

On Ubuntu 9.04, Jlint produced the full path name.  E.g.
target/classes/com/symcor/bs/common/util/jmx/JMXUtils.java:92: Value of referenced variable 'servers' may be NULL.

Notice the path "target/classes" preceeding the package structure.

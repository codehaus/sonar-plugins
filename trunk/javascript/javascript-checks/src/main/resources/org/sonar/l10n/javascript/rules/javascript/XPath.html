<p>This rule enables on to define custom JavaScript rules based on an XPath expression.</p>

<p>
Violations are created depending on the return value of the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a single or list of AST nodes, then a line violation with the given message is created for each node</li>
  <li>a boolean, then a a file violation with the given message is created only if the boolean is true</li>
  <li>anything else, no violation is created</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the following code, the XPath expression //IDENTIFIER[string-length(@tokenValue) >= 10] generates a violation on the identifier "looooooooooong":
</p>

<pre>
function sayHello() {
  var looooooooooong;
  alert("Hello World!");
}
</pre>

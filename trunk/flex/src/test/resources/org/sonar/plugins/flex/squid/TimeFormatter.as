		 * Convert date and time to a string
		 * 
		 * <p>The formats allowed follow the C-style syntax of strftime(). See
		 * http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html
		 * for details. Note: not all formats are currently implemented, I have
		 * only done those ones that were easy to implement using the Date
		 * object.</p>

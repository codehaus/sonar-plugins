# This property is used to check the bundle against a specific version of Sonar.
#
# You must leave this properties to "${sonar.version}" and modify it instead in your POM.
#   - if this property is, let's say, "2.10", then the check will always be done against Sonar-2.10
#   - if this property refers to a snapshot version, then the check will always be done against the master in Github

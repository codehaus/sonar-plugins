When a file has multiple empty lines in the beginning, the line no sent to the submit comments servlet is wrong.
E.g. if source is 
1
2
3
4
5 package com.symcor.sonar.test;
6
7 import org.tmatesoft.svn.core.internal.io.svn.SVNRepositoryFactoryImpl;
8 import org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.SVNRepositoryFactory;

And comment is added on line 7 - at the backend, the comment is not placed on the correct line.




On Submit popup - after unchecking a comment, it is still submitted to the backend


Once a review has been submitted, the comments object should be cleared so that those comments are not available again.



In SVNActionHandler - source.insertComments changes the original source byte array - we don't want that.

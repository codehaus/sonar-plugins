Checks cyclomatic complexity against a specified limit. The complexity is measured by counting decision tags (such as if and forEach) and
boolean operators in expressions ("&amp;&amp;" and "||"), plus one for the body of the document. It is a measure of the minimum number of
possible paths to render the page.

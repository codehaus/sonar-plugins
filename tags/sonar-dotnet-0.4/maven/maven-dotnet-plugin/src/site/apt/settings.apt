Example of maven <<settings.xml>> configuration.

  You may define those settings in the maven install direction <<$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml>> or in the user's specific
  maven configuration <<$HOME/.m2/settings.xml>>. The first method should be preferred if possible as those properties
  should be more considered as "machine specific" rather than "user specific".

  You need to add a profile as below to specify the .Net specific properties. You may or may not activate it by default.
